## Before installation

Let's setup Freebase server first.

1. Install virtuso. See http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/dataspace/doc/dav/wiki/Main/VOSUbuntuNotes
2. Download our Freebase version at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zxv2mos2ujjyxnu/AAACCR4AJ1MMTCe8ElfBN39Ha?dl=0
3. In a terminal, cd to the folder which you just downloaded
4. Run "pwd"
5. Replace /dev/shm/vdb/ in virtuoso.ini with the output of Step 4.
6. Run "virtuoso-t -f"

## Installation

Run the following commands for installation

> git clone https://github.com/sivareddyg/QuestionAnsweringOverFB.git

> sh install.sh

## Replicating experiments in the paper

To reproduce our results, there are two main steps, i.e., KB-based joint inference and Wiki-based inference.
You should perform the inferences in the following order

### Perform the Freebase based joint inference.

> java -cp target/classes:target/lib/* Joint_EL_RE/Test

This will write the output in resources/JointInference/Test/joint_inference.predicted.final

### Perform the wikipedia based inference

> java -cp target/classes:target/lib/* InferenceOverWiki/Test

This will write the output in resources/WikiInference/Test/predicted.8_30

## To train your own models:

The following command will split questions to subquestions and store them in resources/JointInference/Train/train.data. It also creates a feature file at resources/RE/param/params.69 required to train SVMRank model for relation prediction.
> java -cp target/classes:target/lib/* Joint_EL_RE/Train

To build the relation extraction model resources/tool/libsvm-ranksvm-3.20/svm.model, run the following command. [TODO:add the commands]. This model file is required by Joint_EL_RE/Test
